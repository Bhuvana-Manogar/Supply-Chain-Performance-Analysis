## Insights from the Dashboard
- **On-time delivery is about 45 %**, indicating opportunities to tighten logistics and supplier agreements.  
- **AlphaSupplies** manages the highest order volume (~40) but shows the greatest delay rate.  
- Demand concentrates on **Product A** and **Product B** (31 and 29 orders), supporting bulk-purchase or inventory-priority strategies.
